# Exploit-C

### vulnerabilities:

#### Program 1:
The code is vulnerable because of the **type issue** (i.e. unwanted type conversion) that will allows us to overflow the bluffer in *fread*.

#### Program 2:
The code is vulnerable because the lack of bounds check allows us to read past the buffer when line 25 (i += 3) and then line 29 (i++) 
are executed to skip the null bytes in the buffer, which can be leveraged to extract the canary. Then, gets(door) does not check the length of the input
from the user, which allows us to overflow the buffer (making sure to overwrite the canary with itself).
