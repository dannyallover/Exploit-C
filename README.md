# Exploit-C

### vulnerabilities:

#### Program 1:
The code is vulnerable because of the **type issue** (i.e. unwanted type conversion) that will allows us to overflow the bluffer in _fread_.

#### Program 2:
The code is vulnerable because the lack of **bounds check** allows us to read past the buffer when line 25 (_i += 3_) and then line 29 (_i++_) 
are executed to skip the null bytes in the buffer, which can be leveraged to **extract the canary**. Then, _gets(door)_ does not check the length of the input from the user, which allows us to **overflow** the buffer (**making sure to overwrite the canary with itself**).
